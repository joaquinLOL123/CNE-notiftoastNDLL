# NOTIFICATION NDLL FOR CODENAME ENGINE
## i used the [Codename engine ndll example as a base](https://github.com/FNF-CNE-Devs/ndll-example)
## (Code is technically from [vs dave and bambi](https://github.com/BemboLikePizza/VsDave/blob/main/source/PlatformUtil.hx) but i modified it a bit so if you do use this, make sure to credit the devs aswell)
## (specifically [chromasen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgGk4oZt3We-ktkEOV9HY1Q) and [erizur](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdCAaQzt9yOGfFM0gJDJ4bQ) as they're both mentioned to be the programmers for the platform utils)
